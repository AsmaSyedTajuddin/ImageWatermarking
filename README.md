# ImageWatermarking

Ready-made project, source: Udemy ML Bootcamp

In this project, we will see how we can add a watermark to an image. Adding a watermark works as a copyright for your image, so that no one can illegally use your image or document. We will use OpenCV for this project to add logo and text as a watermark.

For this project we need an image url on which we will apply watermark. We will load the image using the url of the image from google images. You can use any image that you desire and replace the url of the image with current url. Next we will read and resize the image and finally store it into two variables for logo and text watermarking.

Conclusion:
Adding a watermark to an image works as a copyright. Different organizations can use it to make their content secure so that their content cannot be misused without thier license or a paid version. In this project we saw how easily we can use OpenCV to add watermarks to our images.
